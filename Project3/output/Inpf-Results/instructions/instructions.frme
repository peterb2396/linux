@TESTING
You are to use three different text files for testing. T@he testing file used for project-1 as well as
the Machine repres@entation of the source code text are to be used as files. Your t@hird file must be
long enough to require many frames to be creat@ed. Your testing must include the following:
1. An error detecti@on by CRC,
2. An error detection by Hamming, and
3. An error det"ection and correction by Hamming.
