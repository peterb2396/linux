language its@elf. You may use a text editor to write your source code file. A@ compiler will be used
to produce a machine representation of yo@ur source code. Such
representation may show your code as hexade@cimal or
binary formats. The resulting hexadecimal code will con@tain combinations of numbers such 1 3 5
8 2 4 6 9 12 21 13 31 14@ 41 15 51 16 61 17 71 18 81 19 91 100 or
