TESTING
You are to use three different text files for testing. The testing file used for project-1 as well as
the Machine representation of the source code text are to be used as files. Your third file must be
long enough to require many frames to be created. Your testing must include the following:
1. An error detection by CRC,
2. An error detection by Hamming, and
3. An error detection and correction by Hamming.
