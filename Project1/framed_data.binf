@Joke:
McAfee-Question: Is Windows a virus?
No, Windows is not a @virus. Here's what viruses do:
1. They replicate quickly-okay, W@indows does that.
2. Viruses use up valuable system resources, s@lowing down the system as they do so-okay,
Windows does that.
3.@ Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk-okay, Win@dows does that too.
4. Viruses are usually carried, unknown to t@he user, along with valuable programs and
systems. Sign... Windo@ws does that, too.
5. Viruses will occasionally make the user su@spect their system is too slow (see 2.) and the
user will buy ne@w hardware. Yup, thatâ€™s with Windows, too.
Until now it seems @Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences:
Viruse@s are well supported by their authors, are running on most syste@ms, their program
code is fast, compact and efficient and they t@end to become more sophisticated as they
mature.
So, Windows is not a virus. It's a bug.
