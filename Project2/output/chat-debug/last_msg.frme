@peter: Joke:
McAfee-Question: Is Windows a virus?
No, Windows is@ not a virus. Here's what viruses do:
1. They replicate quickly-@okay, Windows does that.
2. Viruses use up valuable system resou@rces, slowing down the system as they do so-okay,
Windows does t@hat.
3. Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk-ok@ay, Windows does that too.
4. Viruses are usually carried, unkno@wn to the user, along with valuable programs and
systems. Sign..@. Windows does that, too.
5. Viruses will occasionally make the @user suspect their system is too slow (see 2.) and the
user will@ buy new hardware. Yup, thats with Windows, too.
Until now it se@ems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences:
Vi@ruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most s@ystems, their program
code is fast, compact and efficient and th@ey tend to become more sophisticated as they
mature.
So, Windows is not a virus. It's a bug.
