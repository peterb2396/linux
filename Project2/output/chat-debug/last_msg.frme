@meg: Joke:
McAfee-Question: Is Windows a virus?
No, Windows is n@ot a virus. Here's what viruses do:
1. They replicate quickly-ok@ay, Windows does that.
2. Viruses use up valuable system resourc@es, slowing down the system as they do so-okay,
Windows does tha@t.
3. Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk-okay@, Windows does that too.
4. Viruses are usually carried, unknown@ to the user, along with valuable programs and
systems. Sign... @Windows does that, too.
5. Viruses will occasionally make the us@er suspect their system is too slow (see 2.) and the
user will b@uy new hardware. Yup, thats with Windows, too.
Until now it seem@s Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences:
Viru@ses are well supported by their authors, are running on most sys@tems, their program
code is fast, compact and efficient and they@ tend to become more sophisticated as they
mature.
So, Windows is not a virus. It's a bug.
