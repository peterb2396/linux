McAfee-Question: Is Windows a virus?
No, Windows is not a virus. Here's what viruses do:
1. They replicate quickly-okay, Windows does that.
2. Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as they do so-okay,
Windows does that.
3. Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk-okayl Windows does that too.
4. Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable programs and
systems. Sign... Windows does that, too.
5. Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow (see 2.) and the
user will new hardware. Yup, thats with Windows, too.
