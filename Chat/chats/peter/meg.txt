-YOU: Joke:
-YOU: McAfee-Question: Is Windows a virus?No, Windows is not a virus. Here's what viruses do:1. They replicate quickly-okay, Windows does that.2. Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as they do so-okay,
-YOU: Windows does that.
-YOU: 3. Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk-okay, Windows does that too.
-YOU: 4. Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable programs and
-YOU: systems. Sign... Windows does that, too.
-YOU: 5. Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow (see 2.) and the
-YOU: user will buy new hardware. Yup, thats with Windows, too.
-YOU: Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences:
-YOU: Viruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most systems, their program
-YOU: code is fast, compact and efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as theymature.
-YOU: So, Windows is not a virus. It's a bug.
